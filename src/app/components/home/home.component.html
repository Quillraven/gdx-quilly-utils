  <p>This site contains several utilities that I regularly use for my LibGDX 2D games.</p>
  <p>Feel free to use them as well! :)</p>

  <p class="mt-4">Following utilities can be selected from the menu:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><span class="font-bold">Tile Extruder</span>: extrudes tiles in tilesets to avoid texture bleeding issues.</li>
  </ul>
